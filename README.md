## **Linear Regression from scratch with Ordinary Least Squared and Gradient Descent**

**Project Type**: Machine Learning | Regression  
**Tools Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Dataset**: [Scikit Learn Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset)

### **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to implement linear regression without using Scikit Learn, to gain a deeper understanding of how linear regression works. The model predicts continuous outcomes based on input features, demonstrating how the underlying mathematics, optimization, and evaluation methods work in practice.

### **Key Steps**
- **Data Exploration**: Examined the dataset to ensure it was clean and without null values. Understood key features and any relationships between the input variables and the target variable.
- **Model Implementation**: Built two linear regression models from scratch. One implemented Ordinary Least Squares regression, the other used Gradient Descent.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².

### **Results**  
The model successfully predicted the target variable with reasonable accuracy. The performance was evaluated against Scikit Learn's linear regression and results were close in value.
