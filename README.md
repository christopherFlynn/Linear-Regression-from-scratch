## **Linear Regression from scratch with Ordinary Least Squared and Gradient Descent

**Project Type**: Machine Learning | Regression  
**Tools Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Dataset**: [Scikit Learn Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset)

### **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to implement linear regression from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding of the algorithm's workings. The model predicts continuous outcomes based on input features, demonstrating how the underlying mathematics, optimization, and evaluation methods work in practice.

### **Key Steps**

- **Data Exploration**: Examined the dataset to understand key features and any relationships between the input variables and the target variable.
- **Model Implementation**: Built the linear regression model from scratch by implementing key steps such as gradient descent for optimization and cost function minimization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².

### **Results**  
The model successfully predicted the target variable with reasonable accuracy. The performance was evaluated against a baseline model, showing improvements in prediction quality after tuning hyperparameters.
